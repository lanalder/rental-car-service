# Rental Car Match-making Service
===================================

### In the service of Tourism New Zealand

A single-page website (S.P.A.) which determines the most suitable rental car for users' situations. To keep tourism alive and well in a plague-ridden era this website facilitates bookings and inspires leisure travel for kiwis.

HTML and CSS has been validated, and JS linted via gulp without errors. The [airbnb style-guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) has been mostly adhered to...

Production tools included gulp, in particular its webpack, sass compiler, and linter, although eslint was also used. [blocks.css](https://github.com/thesephist/blocks.css) was used as the main basis for styling, jQuery was employed as a JS library, and plugins included [litepicker](https://github.com/wakirin/Litepicker), [animejs](https://github.com/juliangarnier/anime/), and [parsley](https://parsleyjs.org/) for input validation. Mapbox and turf/length was used as an API, and an honourable mention goes out to paint.net.

Object literals have been used far more frequently than functions, and in a only half successful attempt to cut down on CSS, more DOM elements are created / positioned relative to vp via JS itself.
